# Research Papers

## General survey on the state of the field:

* https://ayameyao.github.io/static/files/publications/A_review_of_computer_vision_technologies_for_plant_phenotyping.pdf
	* This link includes access to the entire paper submitted for publication. It goes over a brief mention of the different data collection methods and the environments that they are situated in. This gave us a good reference point as to the directions or methods that we should try looking into to see what we should try and model.

	* This paper was also a study that looked at the different computer vision (CV) phenotyping, examining the applications of deep learning in research (from 2016-2021). There were a few cited papers as part of the review, one that may yield good results when working with variability in the quality of images. 
	

## Data Pre-processing

* https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8954712
	* This paper leverages AI to isolate the higher quality images to be used to train and test a model, even with images that doesn't have the highest or clearest quality. They suggest using a few different models, but they likely will require us to manually label features or locations that we are interested in the model trying to analyze/predict.

## Ai/ML/DL Applications

* https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09561
	* A paper reseaching the use of deep learning to annotate target regions of images, specifically for grapevine plants. This could be used to identify and isolate berries as part of semantic segmentation, if a model isn't able to generate on it's own.
